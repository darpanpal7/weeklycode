# Counting Valleys
Our goal is to count the number of valleys. A valley is a sequence of steps starting with a step downward  _from sea level_  and ending with a step  _upward to sea level_. Let ***level*** be a variable denoting the current altitude. If we take a step upwards,  is ***level*** incremented by one; if we take step downwards, ***level*** is decremented by one.

Since we know that the sequence of input steps starts and ends at sea level, then we can say that our ***level*** variable is ***0*** at the beginning and end of the hike. The number of valleys can be counted as the number of steps taken upwards to sea level (i.e., when  ***level*** goes from ***-1*** to  ***0***. This is true, because each such step ends the sequence of steps below sea level, signifying the end of a valley.
